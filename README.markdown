# LROAuth2Client Demo Project

This is a simple demo project for the [LROAuth2Client](http://github.com/lukeredpath/LROAuth2Client) library.

You can read more about it on [my blog](http://lukeredpath.co.uk/blog/oauth2-for-iphone-and-ipad-applications.html).

## Getting started

Once you've cloned the project, you'll need to initialize the project submodules:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    
Next, you'll need to create a local copy of OAuthCredentials.h in the root of the project. An example file is provided. To actually run the example, you'll need to sign up with the Facebook Graph API and register an application. Enter your app's credentials in this file.

At this stage, everything should build and run.
